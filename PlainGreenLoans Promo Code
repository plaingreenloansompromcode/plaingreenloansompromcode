A signature loan is a type of loan that only requires your signature and promise to pay. They generally have lower rates than credit cards and higher rates than loans secured with an asset as collateral. Signature loans can include unsecured personal loans.

A signature loan with no credit check is essentially a payday loan complete with risky terms. As with traditional unsecured loans, payday loans don't require collateral, yet interest rates on these loans can easily be over 400%â€”however, their interest rates can be capped by state law. Some states don't allow payday lending at all.
