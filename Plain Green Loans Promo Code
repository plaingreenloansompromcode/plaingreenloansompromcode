Payday alternative loans (PALs): Payday alternative loans (PALs) are offered through credit unions and provide a way for borrowers with imperfect credit to borrow $200 to $1,000. Loan terms typically range from one month to six months, and interest rates are much lower than you'll find with payday loans.
Personal loans for bad credit: Some lenders offer personal loans for bad credit, although they do check your credit when you apply. Interest rates can be as high as 35.99% with these loans, and origination fees of up to 12% of the loan amount aren't uncommon.
Home equity loans: If you have fair credit and a considerable amount of home equity, you can use your home as collateral and get access to cash with a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Just remember that using your home as collateral means you could lose it to foreclosure if you fail to repay.
